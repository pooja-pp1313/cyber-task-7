Browser Extension Security Check

##  Objective
To inspect installed browser extensions for potential privacy and security risks, and remove any suspicious or unused ones.

---

##  Tools Used
- **Browser:** Google Chrome
- **Extension Management:** `chrome://extensions/`

---

##  Process

1. Opened Chrome's extensions page at `chrome://extensions/`.
2. Reviewed installed extensions and their permissions.
3. Found only **one extension installed**: `Google Docs Offline`.
4. Verified its source, permissions, and function.
5. Determined it was safe and useful for offline document editing.
6. No suspicious or unnecessary extensions were found, so **no removal was required**.

##  Extension Reviewed

| Extension Name       | Description                       | Status  | Reason                     |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------|---------|----------------------------|
| Google Docs Offline  | Edit/view Google Docs offline     | ✅ Kept | Pre-installed and trusted  |

##  What I Learned

- Extensions should be regularly reviewed to check for **security risks**.
- Even trusted extensions can request **broad permissions**, so checking them is important.
- Chrome's extension settings allow easy visibility and control over installed tools.
- Keeping the browser clean (only trusted extensions) improves both **performance and security**.

##  Security for Extensions

- Only install from the **Chrome Web Store**
- Avoid tools that request to:
  - “Read and change data on all websites”
  - “Access browser history”
- Remove unused extensions immediately
- Review extension permissions periodically
- Use **incognito restrictions** if needed
